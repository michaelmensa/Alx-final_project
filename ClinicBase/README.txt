ClinicBase
Tagline
Streamlining Clinical Operations with ClinicBase.
Summary
ClinicBase is a medical/health web application designed to streamline daily operations in clinical settings by providing user-friendly department-specific dashboards for patient record management and medical data retrieval.

Team
Daniel Kofi Frempong: Daniel will handle user and storage models.
David Tilkoli:  David will handle APIs, URL routing and server environment setup 
Michael Mensah: Michael will handle client-side codebase.
William Yaw Okyere Dickson: William will handle the front end design
The roles have been assigned in this manner to leverage individual strengths while providing an opportunity for addressing weaknesses across different aspects of web development.
Each role will be led by the individuals mentioned above, but brainstorming sessions will involve the entire team.

Technologies
Front-End Development: HTML/CSS/JavaScript for building the user interface. Vue.js framework for a more dynamic and interactive front end. Alternative frameworks include React and Angular. Though React offers excellent performance and a vast ecosystem, our choice was based on the gentle learning curve of vue.js and the available growing community support.
Back-End Development: Docker virtual server environment setup with Nginx web server that routes incoming requests to the web framework. Server-side language and framework choices include Python/Flask and Node.js/Express.js. Alternative server-side languages and frameworks include: Python/Django, Ruby on Rails, or PHP/Laravel. Though light-weight web frameworks, our choices were based on available skillsets of personnel.
Database Management: Use a relational database system (e.g., MySQL)
Authentication and Security: user authentication and security features using libraries like OAuth, JWT, or security middleware provided by web framework.
Related open-source resources: OpenMRS, HospitalRun, FHIR.
UI Libraries and Templates: Bootstrap, a widely used CSS framework for creating responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.
Hosting and Deployment: Heroku.

Challenge Statement
Problem Statement: The project aims to develop an integrated Database Management System for eye clinics, ENT clinics, and dental clinics in Ghana to address fragmented data management, streamline workflows, improve data accuracy, enhance data security and privacy, enable data analytics, and ensure scalability, ultimately optimising patient care and clinical operations in the country.
Project Limitation: This project will not provide patient dashboards or the capability for patients to book appointments through the web application, focusing instead on optimising internal clinical workflows and data management within eye clinics, ENT clinics, and dental clinics in Ghana.
Users and Beneficiaries: This project will help healthcare providers and patients in Ghana by improving clinical workflows, data accuracy, and patient care while ensuring data security and privacy.
Project Relevance and Dependency: This project is relevant and tailored to the specific healthcare environment and needs within Ghana.

Risks
Technical
Data Security and Privacy: Protecting sensitive patient data with encryption, secure authentication, and regular security audits.
Technical Complexity: Managing the integration of technologies and frameworks with careful planning and adherence to best practices, seeking guidance when needed.
Scalability: Designing the system for scalability from the start, using technologies like load balancers and monitoring performance regularly.
Integration Challenges: Addressing the complexity of integrating with existing systems through clear data standards, thorough testing, and synchronisation.

 Non-technical
User Adoption: Overcoming resistance to change with user training, user-friendly interfaces, involving staff in design/testing, and transparent communication.
Regulatory Compliance: Ensuring adherence to healthcare regulations by consulting experts, educating the team on compliance, and maintaining detailed compliance records.
Data Migration: Handling data migration complexity with a detailed plan, extensive testing, and a rollback strategy for unforeseen issues.
Resource Constraints: Managing limited resources by prioritising critical features, leveraging open-source tools, and seeking guidance from mentors when necessary.

Infrastructure.
 Branch-merge Strategy
Branching strategy: Story/Task branching will be adopted for this project. Team members will work on separate branches. Github workflow will be used in this project.
Merging strategy: Manual code review and merge will be adopted. Updates will be merged into the master branch upon pull request and code review.  

Deployment strategy
Environment management.
Continuous deployment

How to populate the app with data
Database Initialization: We will develop scripts for initialising database schema during the initial application setup. It Include sample data for testing and development
Data Migration: Implement migration scripts for updating the database schema.
Automated Data Seeding: For testing purposes, we will create scripts to seed realistic test data into the database. We will ensure data consistency and integrity during automated data seeding.
 
Tools, Automation process for testing.
Unit Testing: Utilise testing frameworks such unittest and pytests.
Integrate unit tests into CI/CD pipeline for quick feedback.
Develop automated integration tests to ensure proper communication between application components. Tools like Postman or Newman for API integration testing
Implement end-to-end tests for critical workflows using tools like Selenium or Cypress. Automated UI testing ensures a smooth user experience
Conduct performance testing with tools like Apache JMeter or Gatling to evaluate system scalability and response times.
Integrate security testing tools into CI/CD pipeline to identify and address vulnerabilities.
Setup continuous monitoring for application performance, error rates and security metrics.

Existing Solutions.
Similar existing products
Epic Systems: one of the largest providers of EHR systems in the United States, used by many hospitals and healthcare organisations.
Cerner: a prominent EHR system provider known for its comprehensive solutions for healthcare facilities.
Meditech: provides EHR solutions for various healthcare settings, including hospitals and clinics.

Similarities and Differences
Similarities:
Our DBM application will serve other departments in the clinical setups, just like the existing products serve hospital facilities. Our DBM application will have a unique ID system like other existing products.

Differences:
Patients will have the opportunity to access their records and book an appointment on the system before visiting the clinic. Patient data can be easily transferred from one facility to the other with a click of a mouse. Patients can request for medical reports on the system without the need to be physically present at the clinic.
